        </figcaption>
</figure>

ALFRED is an emotional support robot that resides on my desk. The main purpose of the robot
was to gain experience using Arduino microcontrollers, sensors, and servos. ALFRED is a 4 axis robotic arm, utilizing 
four servo motors and a gesture sensor (PAJ7620U2). It can sense numerous hand signals and react accordingly. ALFRED can 
also respond to its own name. I am currently working on further developing this ability as I am dependent on google&rsquo;s 
voice recognition library. A project I am looking into for furthering my <strong>machine learning</strong> knowledge is to implement a 
<strong>neural network</strong> that can recognize the name ALFRED. Moving forward, I hope to applying new computer science and
mechanical engineering concepts I learn from my classes.</p>
<h4 id="software">Software</h4>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/software.png" height="200"/> 
</figure>
 
From a software standpoint, Arduino uses <strong>C/C++</strong>. Since I took two <strong>data structures and algorithms classes in Java</strong>,
the functionality and syntax was relatively straightforward to learn. The Arduino IDE is incredibly helpful for downloading and locating packages 
for specific sensors and servos. After I downloaded the necessary packages, I ensured the file paths were correct and the 
packages were being referenced in the code. Then, I wrote a sketch using a decision structure based on the gesture sensor 
reading which activated the corresponding servo positions and movements. A crucial step was finding each servo&rsquo;s position
limit which is dependent on the design of the arm. During my mechanical design phase of the robotic arm, I wasn&rsquo;t paying attention 
to the orientation of the servos and snapped an arm clean in half. That&rsquo;s when I limited the servo positions to ensure that each servo can&rsquo;t 
break the arm.</p>
<h4 id="hardware">Hardware</h4>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/hardware.JPG" height="300"/> 
</figure>
 
The first major step in the construction of ALFRED was building a functional arm. I used basic <strong>statics</strong> and my understanding of 
weight distribution to construct the arm. Once I was satisfied with the design, I had to integrate the servos, wiring, and 
sensor. I used <strong>Ohm&rsquo;s law</strong> when choosing a power source and wiring path for the servos, ensuring that all the servos were sufficiently
powered. The servos were powered by a 5V DC power supply, while the Arduino directly powered the gesture sensor with 3.3 volts. In order for the gesture sensor to function with the Arduino, I had 
to <strong>solder</strong> the header pins to the sensor, enabling me to use Arduino jumper wires. Finally, I connected all the components 
using a breadboard to keep track of the wiring. I added a singular LED to the servo power circuit to have a visual cue when its active. This 
cue is mainly added precaution to ensure people, including myself, understand when the circuit is live and prevents people from shocking themselves.</p>

            <h4>ALFRED V2</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

The start of Alfred V2 has begun with the base front plate being 3D printed and shown above. I used <strong>SOLIDWORKS</strong> to build the model 
and a Creality Ender 3 Pro 3D Printer to print. I made sure to include guide paths for the wiring which has made soldering the LEDs to 
each letter and the insignia much easier. In addition to this front plate design, I previously 3D printed and designed the 
base motor mount which can be seen below in white. The PLA I used was white but in the picture above I spray painted the front plate with a 
metallic bronze finish. From a software standpoint, I have been reevaluating the use of the current Arduino Uno, or switching over to the 
new Raspberry Pi Pico due to its additional software capabilities. The initial idea was to use the Raspberry Pi 4 that I possess to control the 
Arduino Uno. However, after doing a bit of research into the subject I don&rsquo;t believe this method will enable me to get the full integration that I would want. 
The current plan moving forward is to finish designing and printing all of Alfred&rsquo;s parts. The most troublesome mechanism is going to be the face/claw 
that I am planning to add to the top. This face will be controlled by servos that are connected through strings to enable simple facial expressions (eyebrows, 
eyes, and mouth). I will continue to upload progress of this project and look forward to finishing it by the end of my Spring 2021 semester!

            <h4>Fiber-optics Table</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

The idea of this project was to make a unique, relatively inexpensive side table
that would fit against my main table to form an L shaped desk. The concept of the table 
stemmed from epoxy river tables and fiber-optic lamps. The main effect I wanted to create was
a bioluminescent river that would flow through the table. To maximize the glow of the river,
the table would be stained black. This detail gave me the idea to add a 
star pattern and constellations around the river. I used an orange LED to highlight the 
Big Dipper constellation along with Polaris as they hold special meaning to me.</p>
<h2 id="main-obstacles">Main Obstacles</h2>
<hr>
<h3 id="carving">Carving</h3>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/Carving2.JPG" height="300"/> 
</figure>
 
The carving process was a time-consuming and monotonous step. In the beginning, I started carving the river pattern with 
my Dremel tool equipped with a sanding bit. However, it took 10 minutes and 2 different sanding bits to sand a finger-sized area down 1/4&rdquo;. 
Since this method was inefficient, I brainstormed and eventually developed a peculiar chiseling method. I realized 
through woodworking projects that chiseling can carve substantial material. Although, the major drawback to 
chiseling is the unpredictability associated with cracking, which usually occurs along the grain of the wood.  To combat the unpredictable cracking, 
I theorized that I can limit the cracking if I enclose the area with
deep incisions with the Dremel tool. This enables the surface cracks to occur but limits them to the enclosed area. I 
started at one end of the river pattern and continued to make incisions on the outer edges of the pattern to limit the 
cracking. This method proved to be an effective way to remove more material with high accuracy. Once carved, I did a few 
passes with a mouse sander and this step was finished.</p>
<h3 id="fiber-optics">Fiber-Optics</h3>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/elect2.jpg" height="300"/> 
</figure>
 
This step was interesting as I had absolutely no experience using fiber-optic cables before. 
When I bought them I tried using a light bulb as a light source. I observed that certain cables were brighter than others depending 
on the orientation they were placed in relation to the light bulb. This led me to conclude that I needed a narrower, concentrated beam of light. I tried 
using mirror film to narrow the light from the bulb into more of a direct beam, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the placement of the cables to optimize the reflection. This is 
when I opened my electrical kit and started using singular LEDs. At first, I was skeptical about the LEDs, however they quickly proved effective 
during testing as they provided a much more direct and narrow beam of light. So, I quickly put together a circuit with my knowledge of Ohm&rsquo;s law and wired 
the 5 fiber-optic cable groups to 5 singular LEDs. This worked very well as the blue and white LEDs gave the table a starry, bioluminescent effect.
The orange LED gave a perfect accent to the starry sky, outlining the constellations with a warm orange/golden hue. I was 
very pleased with this step.</p>
<h3 id="epoxy">Epoxy</h3>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/epoxy.jpg" height="300"/> 
</figure>
 
The epoxy step was where I ran into a major issue. The main error stemmed from my overestimation of the viscosity of
epoxy resin. Since this was my first project using epoxy resin, I concluded from online sources that epoxy had a high 
enough viscosity to trap the fiber-optic cables without the need of any holding mechanisms for the cables themselves.
I soon realized this was not the case. While I was pouring the epoxy resin, the cables continued to pull themselves out of the 
resin. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that the cables were laid onto the river pattern using three different input holes. 
These holes were drilled straight through the board, and the cables were fed through from underneath the table, attached, and sealed. This meant that the 
fiber-optic cables needed to be bent 90 degrees to stay within the river pattern. Despite the flexibility of the cables, the bending 
angle of 90 degrees required more holding force than the viscous force of epoxy resin. This lead to the use of parchment paper and 
my toolbox to slam all the wires down once the epoxy was poured to ensure all the cables would be submerged. However, this 
meant that I had little control over the cable placement. Additionally, I had to quickly address this problem because the two part epoxy 
resin was mixed together, so I had about a 30 minutes time frame before the resin starts setting. The solution worked relatively well 
as the cables were embedded into the epoxy. Although, the epoxy areas in direct contact with the parchment paper became clouded which 
was the collateral damage to my technique. I tried sanding and polishing the clouded sections down but had no luck. Overall, this step went well despite 
the initial problems.</p>
<h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h2>
<hr>
<p>This project proved to be more difficult than anticipated, but the engineering process was something I thoroughly enjoyed. 
I had to use my previous <strong>woodworking experiences</strong>, online resources, and <strong>electricity concepts</strong> to execute this 
project. Additionally, the fiber-optic table gave me more insight into electricity and the nuances involved in real-world application. 
Moving forward, I want to incorporate more electrical components 
into my future projects to further develop my knowledge in circuits, bridging the gap between real-world application and the classroom setting. 
The fiber-optic table challenged me as a builder with the obstacles and issues we ran into. However, I overcame them and gained a better 
understanding in different areas of expertise along with a beautiful table that still functions in my room today.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

This project was an extremely fun, enlightening, and useful build. The magic mirror concept 
has been around for a while, so there are numerous github pages and videos explaining 
how to build one. However, I added certain widgets and went for a frameless design
to further personalize my mirror. The mirror itself is comprised of a wooden frame and glass with a two-way mirror film. 
When light is blocked out from one side of the film, the other side becomes completely reflective. Since the program runs a 
black background, the text and images shine through the glass while the background is reflective, 
creating the magic mirror effect. No matter how many times I check my mirror, the view never gets old.</p>
<h2 id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways</h2>

<h3 id="raspberry-pilinux">Raspberry Pi/Linux</h3>
<p><figure class="pull-left">
    <img src="/images/mirror2.JPG" height="300"/> 
</figure>
 
Everything about the Raspberry Pi and Linux was relatively new to me, from uploading the OS onto the SD card to 
maneuvering around files throughout the device. This experience allowed me to learn <strong>bash commands</strong> to alter, move, and 
work with files. I also furthered my understanding of <strong>Git</strong> as I used clones from github to obtain localized versions of 
files and add-ons. Additionally, I configured my Raspberry Pi to my MacBook Air through <strong>Microsoft Remote Desktop</strong>. This allowed 
me to remote access my Raspberry Pi without having to directly use the mirror. Another learning experience I had was with the <strong>audio inputs and 
outputs</strong> of the Raspberry Pi. I configured a usb microphone and usb speaker to the Raspberry Pi. However, I couldn&rsquo;t get my Python script, 
which transferred the microphone input into text through <strong>google&rsquo;s voice recognition library</strong>, to register the microphone. Based on 
online forums, there seemed to be issues with Raspberry Pi 4 <strong>audio drivers</strong> which were common but extremely hard to solve. Overall I have learned and 
experimented with my Raspberry Pi, facilitating me with experience that can be not only be applied to Raspberry Pi devices but 
also other linux devices and projects down the line.</p>
<h3 id="software-concepts">Software Concepts</h3>
<p>The magic mirror software exposed me to different types of files and computer science concepts. <strong>API keys</strong> were a crucial concept 
to understand, enabling the magic mirror to obtain localized information and weather. I added a Spotify module that used 
<strong>OAuth Tokens</strong> which allow the magic mirror to obtain user data from my Spotify account. These two concepts are very powerful in terms 
of application building and obtaining data. I also added a significant amount of phrases that would change according to the 
weather and time of day. This was implemented using a standard decision structure in JSON. Moving forward, I plan to experiment and research
further into <strong>JSON</strong> for web development purposes as it remains an incredibly powerful tool.</p>
