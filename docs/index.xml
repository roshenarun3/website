      <description>Overview    ARK 1   Ark 1 is a drone that will have autonomous and manual capabilities. Currently, the drone has been built and tested, ensuring manual and semi-autonomous modes are fully functional (RTL, Land, Loiter). Additionally, the drone has been operated through Raspberry Pi and Python, displaying its autonomous capabilities. Moving forward requires testing on large-scale aerial facilities due to the hazards of autonomous testing.</description>

      <description>Table of contents   Overview   Main Obstacles  Carving Fiber-Optics Epoxy Takeaway    Gallery  Overview    Fiber-optics Table   The idea of this project was to make a unique, relatively inexpensive side table that would fit against my main table to form an L shaped desk. The concept of the table stemmed from epoxy river tables and fiber-optic lamps. The main effect I wanted to create was a bioluminescent river that would flow through the table.</description>

      <description>Table of contents   Overview   Main Takeaways  Raspberry Pi/Linux Software Concepts   Overview    Magic Mirror   This project was an extremely fun, enlightening, and useful build. The magic mirror concept has been around for a while, so there are numerous github pages and videos explaining how to build one. However, I added certain widgets and went for a frameless design to further personalize my mirror.</description>
