Ark 1 is a drone that will have autonomous and manual capabilities. Currently, the drone has been built and tested, ensuring manual and
semi-autonomous modes are fully functional (RTL, Land, Loiter). Additionally, the drone has been operated through Raspberry Pi and Python, displaying 
its autonomous capabilities. Moving forward requires testing on large-scale aerial facilities due to the hazards of autonomous testing.
