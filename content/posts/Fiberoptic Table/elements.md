## Overview

{{< figure src="/images/NightFiberOpticTable.JPG" title="Fiber-optics Table" height="400" >}}
The idea of this project was to make a unique, relatively inexpensive side table
that would fit against my main table to form an L shaped desk. The concept of the table 
stemmed from epoxy river tables and fiber-optic lamps. The main effect I wanted to create was
a bioluminescent river that would flow through the table. To maximize the glow of the river,
the table would be stained black. This detail gave me the idea to add a 
star pattern and constellations around the river. I used an orange LED to highlight the 
Big Dipper constellation along with Polaris as they hold special meaning to me.

## Main Obstacles
----
### Carving

The carving process was a time-consuming and monotonous step. In the beginning, I started carving the river pattern with 
my Dremel tool equipped with a sanding bit. However, it took 10 minutes and 2 different sanding bits to sand a finger-sized area down 1/4". 
Since this method was inefficient, I brainstormed and eventually developed a peculiar chiseling method. I realized 
through woodworking projects that chiseling can carve substantial material. Although, the major drawback to 
chiseling is the unpredictability associated with cracking, which usually occurs along the grain of the wood.  To combat the unpredictable cracking, 
I theorized that I can limit the cracking if I enclose the area with
deep incisions with the Dremel tool. This enables the surface cracks to occur but limits them to the enclosed area. I 
started at one end of the river pattern and continued to make incisions on the outer edges of the pattern to limit the 
cracking. This method proved to be an effective way to remove more material with high accuracy. Once carved, I did a few 
passes with a mouse sander and this step was finished. 

### Fiber-Optics

This step was interesting as I had absolutely no experience using fiber-optic cables before. 
When I bought them I tried using a light bulb as a light source. I observed that certain cables were brighter than others depending 
on the orientation they were placed in relation to the light bulb. This led me to conclude hat I needed a narrower, concentrated beam of light. I tried 
using mirror film to narrow the light from the bulb into more of a direct beam, but I couldn't get the placement of the cables to optimize the reflection. This is 
when I opened my electrical kit and started using singular LEDs. At first, I was skeptical about the LEDs, however they quickly proved effective 
during testing as they provided a much more direct and narrow beam of light. So, I quickly put together a circuit with my knowledge of Ohm's law and wired 
the 5 fiber-optic cable groups to 5 singular LEDs. This worked very well as the blue and white LEDs gave the fiber-optics a starry, bioluminescent effect.
The orange LED gave a perfect accent to the starry sky, outlining the constellations with a warm orange/golden hue. I was 
very pleased with this step. 

### Epoxy

The epoxy step was where I ran into a major issue. The main error stemmed from my overestimation of the viscosity of
epoxy resin. Since this was my first project using epoxy resin, I concluded from online sources that epoxy had a high 
enough viscosity to trap the fiber-optic cables without the need of any holding mechanisms for the cables themselves.
I soon realized this was not the case. While I was pouring the epoxy resin, the cables continued to pull themselves out of the 
resin. This behavior can be attributed to the fact that the cables were laid onto the river pattern using three different input holes. 
These holes were drilled straight through the board, and the cables were fed through, attached, and sealed. This meant that the 
fiber-optic cables needed to be bent 90 degrees to stay within the river pattern. Despite the flexibility of the cables, the bending 
angle of 90 degrees required more holding force than the viscous force of epoxy resin. This lead to the use parchment paper and 
my toolbox to slam all the wires down once the epoxy was poured to ensure all the cables would be submerged. However, this 
meant that I had little control over the cable placement. I had to quickly address this problem because the two part epoxy 
resin was mixed together, so I had about a 30 minutes time frame before the resin starts setting. The solution worked relatively well 
as the cables were embedded into the epoxy. Although, the epoxy areas in direct contact with the parchment paper became clouded which 
was the collateral damage to my technique. I tried sanding it down and polishing but had no luck. Overall, this step went well despite 
the initial problems. 


## Takeaway
----
This project proved to be more difficult than anticipated, but the engineering process was something I thoroughly enjoyed. 
I had to use my previous woodworking experiences, online resources, and electricity concepts from Physics 2 to execute this 
project. Additionally, being able to take abstract concepts from a class such as physics 2 and apply them into the real-world gave 
me more insight into electricity and the nuances involved. Moving forward, I want to incorporate more electrical components 
into my future projects and develop my knowledge in circuits, bridging the gap between real-world application and the classroom setting. 
The fiber-optic table challenged me as a builder with the obstacles and issues we ran into. However, I overcame them and gained a better 
understanding in different areas of expertise along with a beautiful table that still functions in my room today.
